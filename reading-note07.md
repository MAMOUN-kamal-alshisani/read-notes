# Read: 07 - Design web pages with CSS:
*CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.
 For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream,all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface,or that all level one headings should be in a blue,italic, Times typeface*.
### Foreground Color:
*The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:*
* rgb values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.
* For example: rgb(100,100,90)
 hex Codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
* Color names There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan
We look at these three different ways of specifying colors on the next double-page spread.*

### understanding Color :
***very color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.***

*Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them).*

*When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture.*

*The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue â€” just like on a television screen*
