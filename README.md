## first mind growth : 
mind growth is very important in our life because it is what makes us grow and learn in life, A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed.
# What fixed mindset looks like :
1. does not do Challenges
2. avoid Obstacles
3. does not make any Effort
4. ignore Criticisms
5. does not want the Success of others

** Growing at work, and outside work too
I’ve been guilty of having a fixed mindset far too often, and I’m working to change that. Things like wisdom and achievement are the products of putting in hard work, not avoiding it. We live in a society where the instant gratification monkey sits on everyone’s shoulder. But the pleasures that result from determination and hard work far outweigh anything that devilish chimp has to offer. The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective.

Maybe all this seems obvious to you, in which case, you’re lucky. For me, I’ve found that taking the time to assess what I’m doing is tremendously effective in keeping me on track at work. When I feel myself losing focus, I try to remember that short-term frustration will likely result in long-term improvement of my abilities – if I just stay with it. A growth mindset opens me up to more creativity and possibility, and I discover I’m able to achieve more and set higher goals. **
