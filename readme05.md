# Read: 05 - Operators and Loops :
** OPERATORS 
Expressions rely on things called operators they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. greeting-- Hi  + Molly.**
 ** there is three types of Operators : 1.arithmatic Operators. 2.asignment operators. 3.comparison operators.**
 ***Looking at a flowchart (for all but the most basic scripts), the code can take more than one path, which means the browser runs different code in different situations. In this chapter, you will learn how to create and control the flow of data in your scripts to handle different situations. 
Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and/or the browser window itself. To determine which path to take, programmers often rely upon the following three concepts:*** 
** EVALUATIONS You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results.** 
### DECISIONS & LOOPS 
** DECISIONS Using the results of evaluations,you can decide which path your script should go down. 
LOOPS There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeated **

***USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS:as you can see that an if ... e1se statement allows you to provide two sets of code: 1. one set if the condition evaluates to true 2. another set if the condition is false 
In this test, there are two possible outcomes: a user can either get a score equal to or greater than the pass mark (which means they pass), or they can score less than the pass mark (which means they fail). One response is required for each eventuality. The response is then written to the page. 
Note that the statements inside an if statement should be followed by a semicolon, but there is no need to place one after the closing curly brace of the code blocks***

# TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING :
*JavaScript is said to use weak typing because the data type for a value can change. Some other languages require that you specify what data type each variable will be. They are said to use strong typing*
# SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES 
*Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or fa 1 se).*
