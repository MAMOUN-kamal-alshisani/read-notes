### EXPRESSIONS :
*An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions:*
* EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE:

*In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign). var color = 'beige';* 
 *The value of co1or is now beige.* 

*When you first declare a variable using the var keyword,it is given a special value of undefined. This will change when you assign a value to it. Technically,undefined is a data type like a number, string, or Boolean.* 

* EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE :
*You can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page) to determine a single value.
For example: var area = 3 * 2;
*The value of area is now 6.* 

### OPERATORS :
*Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.*
* ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
Assign a value to a variable color = 'beige'; 
The value of co 1 or is now beige 
* ARITHMETIC OPERATORS 
Perform basic math area = 3 * 2; 
The value of area is now 6
* STRING OPERATORS 
Combine two strings greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Molly'; 
* COMPARISON OPERATORS 
Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se buy = 3 > 5; 
* LOGICAL OPERATORS 
Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); 

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
*Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).*
