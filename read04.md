## Read: 04a - Dynamic web pages with JavaScript.
**html is a structure for a web page but javascript is what makes a web page dynamic!!**
**it goes through three stages one is** **1.html** **2.css** **3.javascript.**
## what is javascript?
**JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not
need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an
HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day**
## how do i write a script for web page?
It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.
